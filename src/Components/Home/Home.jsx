                    My full name is Marek Mason Carlisle, and I love spacetime, technology, and cats!

                    I study programming! I am most proficient with Javascript,
                    however I have been expanding outwards with Python. I have more languages planned to be learned as they become relevant to my goals.
                    I need to learn C# for Unity game making, Python will introduce me to AI/ML, and lower level languages
                    such as Assembly will one day teach me how computers work from a base level.

                    I study astronomy! Along with other abstract sciences such as physics, psychology, geoscience, and logic.
                    These ideas interest me because I love the fact that there is more to life, the universe, and the infinite
                    than what is in front of our eyes. Infinity is my infatuation, and technology will give me the power to explore it.
                    I will learn how to create simulations and charts, how to tap into libraries that utilize satellite data and other such relevant tools, all the while creating
                    videogames based on these beautiful concepts.

                    I want to travel! Fun fact: I've been to 2 states my entire life. North Dakota and Minnesota. I'm trying hard to change this, because
                    there is a whole world that I have not seen. I've a list of places I want to go. One of which includes my dream island: Hawaii. Where the sun
                    is hot, and the rain is frequent. I dream of owning a home here, and spending my time on the beaches of paradise.

                    Other skills that I want to learn includes: Art, music, language, and speech. If I want to create videogames, it's
                    rather obvious that I need to know how to create art and music for my games. I am a beginner in all of these skillsets, but doing work
                    to improve them has been, or has become a hobby for me.
